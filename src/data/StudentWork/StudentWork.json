        "description": "Phantasm Atlas is an interactive video installation reimagining our bodily anatomy. \n \nIn this installation-performance,  participants wear a silicone sleeve and steer through an Atlas Scan of their body, without the hassle of outdated imaging technology or dissection. To navigate through the experience, users hit the pods on the wearable, and they softly glow in response (or is it in protest?). This project begins as a diagrammatic journey, but becomes an expressive meditation on the structures that quietly restrict the autonomy of certain bodies, while framing radical re-imagination as a way to set us free.",

        "description": "'Real Shadows Shine' was created as the final assignment for my 'Intelligent Agents' course. This course explored biomimickry in software development with a heavy focus on life simulation in game AI. In 'Real Shadows Shine', Miller applied these technical strategies to create simulated desert environments of herding creatures that are trying to avoid the sun. The player has a rock that can be spun in place. This alternative interface, which was developed with Arduino, modifies the orientation of the sun. Through this simple mechanic, players are able to change the length and direction of the shadows in the environment, and in so doing guide the simulated inhabitants across the great expanse of desert.",

The house is completely dark and the only way for Player One to see where they are is for Player 2 to turn on the lights using the circuit breakers. If Player 2 turns on more than 5 lights simultaeously the neighbors will become suspicous and the timer will run significantly faster.",

In order to weave through crowds the player must incorporate audio (loud noises or throat clears) to move on. Throughout the experience/game, the player has a limited energy level that depletes the longer the player remains in the crowded space. Random hideouts and hidden rooms are dispersed around the space for the player to discover and “recharge” mentally before moving on. \n \n The goal of this game is to place players in a situation in which crowds appear to be overwhelming and exhausting. With the incorporation of audio input from the player, the game demonstrates the additional effort and energy required to be acknowledged and “exist” in a large, social situation. The search for hidden havens and hideouts is also intended to depict the satisfaction in finding spaces away from concentrated areas where the player can take time to breath and meditate. ",

The protestors position themselves adamantly against the apparent configuration of power represented by the U.S Military in configuration with the strictures of American cultural norms. That is, against the Taylorized work environment, the office and the punch card. The office in the photograph exceeds its locality, standing in as model for a fate to be avoided. The protestors destroy the image and the system. In its place, they insert an image of a haphazard jumble of information colliding with itself.",

Rooted in the concept of Pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon triggered by the temporal lobe of the brain, where neurons are responsible for face and object recognition. Feeding refined and intentional image data through many layers of a Convolutional Neural Network, via TensorFlow, we have created a series of images and titles, given by our machine, in attempt to invoke human psychological phenomena through code. I handled the technical aspects of this piece, learning to use TensorFlow’s pretrained Inception model to classify our images. Through several tests with varying parameters, I came to a method of running the Python scripts on our images to get data that was not obvious (as in “cloud”), and with weights that carried our code more into the abstraction between machine and psychology.",
